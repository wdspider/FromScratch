## Description
A little mod that blanks out the whole map and then spawns a few basic things needed to start base creation. The mod supports 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
You can also choose to start with a buddy, if desired.

Easy sets the whole map to turf; spawns 11 trees; and spawns 4 seeds, sticks, and stones.

Medium sets the whole map to Fresh Water (Deep) except for 441 center tiles: 320 Fresh Water (Shallow) and 121 Turf. 6 trees are spawned with 3 seeds, sticks, and stones.

Hard sets the whole map to Fresh Water (Deep) except for 16 center tiles: 12 Fresh Water (Shallow) and 4 Turf. 1 tree is spawned with 1 log, 1 mallet, 2 seeds, 3 sticks, and 3 stones.
